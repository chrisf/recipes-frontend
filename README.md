# Why?

The purpose of this project is to familiarize myself with GraphQL, Apollo Server/Client and Prisma

I wanted to be able to actually use this for something and my wife suggested pulling ingredients/directions from recipes and being able to tag/search them later

# Running

There is a docker-compose included, run `docker-compose up -d` to bring up the postgres db

`npm run dev` to build and run the frontend

It is expected that the backend is running at http://localhost:4000

There is a separate backend project [here](https://github.com/chrisf/recipes-backend)
